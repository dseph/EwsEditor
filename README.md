Each release of EWSEditor includes the distribution of the EWS Managed API it was built for. EWSEditor uses .NET Framework version 4.5.1 which can be downloaded here: .NET Framework 4.5.1. The project is under Visual Studio 2013. This version of EwsEditor uses EWS Managed API built from GIT. The EWS Managed API requires a minimal of .NET 3.5. A copy of the 2.2 version of the EWS managed API is included in case you wish to use it instead of the version built from GIT.
