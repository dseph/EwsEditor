Wish List

    In Autodiscover Viewer window have the abilility to specify the Autodiscover asmx URL instead of only allowing Autodiscover to it.

    Add processing for working with custom search folders.

    Add hex editing ability for binary properties.

    In the Options and AutodiscoverViewer window have a place to set additional headers - this should be similar to what 
EwsPost has.
