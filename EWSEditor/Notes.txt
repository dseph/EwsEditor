
Under consideration:

	Merge the EWS Steaming sample from codeplex into EWSEditor.

	Cross mailbox searches using an impersonation account.  This is not e-discovery.

	Merge in code from EWSRelntless from codeplex.

	A window to pull calendar information across a specified timespan from a list of mailboxes at a set interval. 
	A specified amount of data could be pulled.
	This is calendar access. 
	Impersonation and delegate access would need to supported.  This would be a type of load testing.

	This is getuserailabilty. 
	his would be a type of load testing.  

	Round robin queue of service accounts for accessing mailboxes.  Basic calendar/inbox access could be done. 
	This type of queue can be used with an account doing delegate acces against many mailboxes in order to 
	spread the load and avoid back-off throttling.

	Add the EWS Push Notifcation sample to EWSEditor.

	Add a window which shows a page that has links to related tools and provides information on them.
